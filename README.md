# Writing lecture

A short lecture on writing and reproducible writing, given at UCSC STAT 200 class, Fall 2020.  

I owe much of the materials on general writing tips in this slides deck, and my own training in writing, to the STAT 572 class at University of Washington. An older version of that course with many useful links can be found [here](https://courses.washington.edu/b572/lecture2014.htm).
