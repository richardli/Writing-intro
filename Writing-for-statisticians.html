# You will write a lot, I mean, really a lot 

In academia, there is a **a lot** of writing: papers, thesis, lectures, proposals, ...

--

Writing well helps a lot to get your papers published, your work more visible, and your arguments more convincing.

--

&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Part I&lt;/span&gt;
+ How to write well 
+ Writing technical material

--

&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Part II&lt;/span&gt;
+ LateX and BibTeX
+ Reproducibility and R Markdown

### _Writing is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness_
.right[George Orwell (1903 – 1950) Author and Journalist]



Writing is a struggle, for _everyone_. 



Can we really learn "how to write well" in an hour? Apparently not :)

--

Important topics I will not cover today include
+ Word choice
+ Grammar
+ Punctuation
+ ...

--

I will focus on a few 'big picture' principles instead. 

---
### _Easy reading is damn hard writing_
.right[Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804 -- 1864) Novelist]

#### Which do you prefer?
* The promise of our new approach is reduction of bias.
* Our new approach promises to reduce bias.

--

#### Principles of clarity
* Make main character subjects.
* Make important actions verbs.

---
### _Learn as much by writing as by reading_
.right[Baron John Acton (1834–1902) Historian and Moralist]


A _sometimes useful_ advice: avoid writing in passive voice. 

--

Over-using passive voice is a common mistake:	

- The bias was reduced by our approach.

--

But sometimes can be helpful in discussing abstract ideas:

- Super-efficiency has been seen in some Bayesian estimators.

--

A better advice: _make your 'character' the subject and go to your point quickly._

### _The difficulty is not to write, but to write what you mean_
.right[Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 –- 1894) Novelist and Travel Writer]



Your paper is not just about the information, it is actual communication.

--

Tell a story.
--
	
- Why you are writing the paper?
- What is the sequence of ideas you want to tell the reader?
- Will the reader be interested/curious when reading my paper?

--

Use minimalism to achieve clarity.
--

- Is it possible to preserve my message without that X?
- Decide 2-3 points you want every reader to remember from your paper.
- Keep each paragraph to a single message.

--

Be precise.
--

- 'worked quite well' or 'had X% better accuracy than'
- 'did not work' or 'failed to converge'



---
### _Every single word that I publish, I write at least six times_
.right[Paul Halmos, Author, 'How to write mathematics']

#### Editing matters
--

+ If an explanation 'sort-of' works to you, your reader will be totally lost.
--

+ Catching your own errors is hard. Reading sections aloud may help. 
--

+ Version control your writing (remember our git tutorial?)
--

+ Get someone to read through your writing.
&lt;!-- + Leave your writing for a while and come back to it. --&gt;
  
--

#### Editing takes time
--

+ The return of repeated editing diminish eventually, but you probably have a deadline before then.  
--

+ Insufficient editing is obvious -- and unimpressive.
--

+ Over-edited papers are rare. But over-editing is common!
--

--

+ My strategy is to first write everything I have in mind down, before fine tuning each sentence in the introduction to make them perfectly fit in their boxes (unless I really feel the urge to do that). 
--

+ You should develop your own strategy that works for you. 



---
# Writing technical materials

In general, rules of formal writing apply.

--

Even in math-y materials, everything should be in complete sentences.
- Bad:    Consider `\(\hat\theta_n, n &gt; p\)`.
- Good:   Consider `\(\hat\theta_n\)`, where `\(n &gt; p\)`.
- Better: Consider the estimator `\(\hat\theta_n\)`, where `\(n &gt; p\)`.

--

Be precise with words:
- principle components or principal components
- causal or casual
- the 'statistical' meaning vs the 'lay' meaning: confidence, consistent, robust, profile, ... 

--

Show the relevant information:
- graphics with clear annotations.
- explain what is in the table/figure in captions.

---
# Main takeaways
1. Do not be afraid of writing.
2. Write to tell a story: within a sentence, paragraph, and paper.
3. Be formal, precise, and clear.
4. Edit your writing.

# LaTeX 

LaTeX is a software system for document preparation.
	
    \documentclass{article}
    \title{An example}
    \author{Your Name}
    \begin{document}
    \maketitle
    \section{Introduction}
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_{it} = \alpha + \beta_{it}
    \end{equation}
    %\bibliographystyle{apalike} 
    %\bibliography{mybib}
    \end{document}

How to compile LaTeX documents
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a useful place to start.
- My setup: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) + [LaTeXTools](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
- Using a [Makefile](https://github.com/richardli/Writing-intro/blob/master/tex-examples/Makefile) from command line.
- There are many other editors.


---
# BibTex

BibTex is a plain text database.

    @article{cox1972regression, 
        author = {Cox, D. R.},
        title = {Regression Models and Life-tables (with Discussion)},
        year = {1972},
        journal = {Journal of the Royal Statistical
        Society, Series B: Methodological},
        volume = {34},
        pages = {187--220} 
    }

--

+ The citation key should be sane, short, and easier to identify for you and your collaborators, e.g. _last-name-year-first-word_


--

+ Protect upper/lower cases with {}, e.g., `a {B}ayesian approach`; `Mike D'{A}ntoni`

--

+ A somewhat strange compile workflow (sometimes handled by your editor internally): LaTeX -&gt; BibTex -&gt; LaTeX -&gt; LaTeX


---
# BibTex

+ Google scholar gives these in plain text. So do many publisher's sites. Auto-generated bib entries are (usually) not perfect, so be sure to check them. 

--

+ Some bib database management software are also popular: Zotero, Mendeley, JabRef, etc.  

--

+ Check with your target journal what bib style they use. Use `\bibliographystyle{}` to specify appropriate styles. `natbib` is usually helpful.

--

+ In general, if you wonder if you should cite something, then you probably should. These include: technical report, news report, blog quote, personal communication, data sources, R packages, ... 


---
# Reproducible research

The purpose of research is not just solving a problem, but to teach people how to solve similar problems. 

--

A good research paper should contain enough information to allow an informed reader to reproduce/verify the results.
--

- proofs
- implementable algorithms and parameter settings
- data or how to obtain the data (whenever possible)

--

Informal documents can usually also benefit greatly from reproducibility.

--

What's the benefit for _you_?
- You usually need to re-run your analysis or re-visit some parts of the project in the future. 
- You can more easily recycle re-useable parts for the future.
- Collaborators like you more!

---
# R Markdown 
The idea behind dynamic documents: code + narrative = report.

--

Others can reproduce the analysis and read your analysis together with codes and data: easier for others to understand your work and identify places of potential improvements.

--

The automation of documentation also minimizes cutting and pasting, where errors usually happen.

--

It also improves research product pipeline (e.g., periodic routine reports with new data).  

--

R Markdown has a short history. It was introduced by Yihui Xie in the `knitr` package in 2012. It quickly became the more popular format for dynamic documents.

# Basic format options

A generic **linear regression** model example:


```r
data(cars)
fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
plot(fit)
```

&lt;img src="Writing-for-statisticians_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="25%" /&gt;&lt;img src="Writing-for-statisticians_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png" width="25%" /&gt;&lt;img src="Writing-for-statisticians_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-3.png" width="25%" /&gt;&lt;img src="Writing-for-statisticians_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-4.png" width="25%" /&gt;

The slope of the regression is 3.932.


---
# Basic format options

Behind the scenes, this is what the codes look like:

    A generic **linear regression** model example:

    ```{r, out.width = '25%'}
    data(cars)
    fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
    plot(fit)
    ```
    The slope of the regression is `r round(coef(fit)[2], 3)`.

--

Basically you need
+ Text with simple formatting
+ Code chunks with options 
+ Inline code results

_More details: [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and StackOverflow_

---
# Basic format options
R Markdown document starts with a chunk of YAML metadata:

    ---
    title: The Real North
    author: Jon Snow
    date: 2021-01-01
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
    ---

You can (almost) treat the narrative part in the R Markdown file as a LaTeX document and write many backslashes (when compiling pdf output), or you can use markdown syntax.


---
# Advanced format options

There are many additional packages in R that make output prettier (not all work seamlessly with pdf output unfortunately).



```r
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)

fit %&gt;% summary() %&gt;% xtable() %&gt;% kable(digits=4)
```



|            | Estimate| Std. Error| t value| Pr(&gt;&amp;#124;t&amp;#124;)|
|:-----------|--------:|----------:|-------:|------------------:|
|(Intercept) | -17.5791|     6.7584| -2.6011|             0.0123|
|speed       |   3.9324|     0.4155|  9.4640|             0.0000|

# More about R Markdown

- More tips:
    + Use relative paths.
    + Set seed.
    + Follow a style guide in coding, tidy your codes manually or with `Tidy = TRUE`.
    + Use `session_info()` to document package versions.
    + Use README file to give moreb instructions (package versions, directory structures, any additional dependencies).

--

- [A longer template example](https://github.com/jkang37/R-Markdown-Template)  from Jizhou Kang.

--

- R Markdown is a great tool, but sometimes it falls short. 
    - For example, if your analysis contains long computation and/or large dataset. 
    - For your research purposes, it is more important to think about what your reproducible research flow should look like.

--

- &lt;span style="color:royalblue"&gt;The goal of most writing is to convey the information and message (to others or to yourself). When writing R Markdown documents, rules of good writing still apply.&lt;/span&gt;
