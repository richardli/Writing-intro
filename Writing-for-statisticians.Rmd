# You will write a lot, I mean, really a lot 

In academia and beyond, there is a **a lot** of writing: papers, thesis, lectures, proposals, reports, analysis plans, ...

--

Writing well helps a lot to get your papers published, your work more visible, and your arguments more convincing.

--

Can we really learn "how to write well" in an hour? Apparently not :)

--

Important topics I will not cover today include
+ Word choice
+ Grammar
+ Punctuation
+ ...

--

I will focus on a few 'big picture' principles instead.

# Writing is a struggle for everyone

### _Writing is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness_
.right[George Orwell (1903 – 1950) Author and Journalist]


---
# Why do we write?

--

The goal of writing anything is usually **communication**. 

--

We start with some complex ideas, data analysis, years of messing around some combinations of math, theorems, computer codes, data insights, nuances, ...

--

We need to turn them into understandable summaries that are 
+ accessible
+ actionable 
+ clear and precise
+ transparent and trustable


--

What is missing?

--

All the above are relative to what the **target audience** is. So always be clear about: <span style="color:royalblue">who am I writing this to, and who might want to read what I write!</span>

# How do we write well?

#### _Learn as much by writing as by reading_

#### _Easy reading is damn hard writing_

###<span style="color:royalblue"> The best way to learn how to write well is through reading and reflecting on what you read.</span>

# How do academic papers communicate (1)

Usually, a statistics paper are structured into Abstract -> Introduction -> Methods -> Evaluations -> Discussion.

--

**Abstract**: a concise summary of the entire paper (more later)

--

**Introduction**: what you want your reader to know

--

Clear context and motivation: what problem you are addressing and why it is important. It may include both a scientific problem and statistical problems.

--

Literature review: what has been done now and how are they related to your work.

--

Your proposal: what you did and how does it contribute to the field.

--

<span style="color:red">Write as if you are reading: </span> would I be interested in keep reading the paper?

--

<span style="color:royalblue">Practically: </span> I usually write the introduction early to clear my mind on what I want to write in the paper, repeatedly edit it, and usually finish the section at the very end of the writing process. 



---
# How do academic papers communicate (2)

--

**Methods section(s)**: 

+ You probably spend most of the time developing the technical aspect of this section. But you effort and word count are likely not proportional. 

--

+ Often the section(s) consist of the main outline of methods. Many details may be left to the appendix. 

--

+ The section(s) need to be self-contained with clear notations established, assumptions stated, and model choice justified. Do not assume your readers think the same way as you and use the same notations by default. 

--

+ When the method is complicated and layered, the method section(s) may need a story arc (just like when organizing the paper) for readers to follow.  


---
# How do academic papers communicate (3)

**Result section(s)**: 

--
+ Structure the results logically 
+ Demonstrate validity
+ Demonstrate comparisons
+ Highlight scientific importance and interpretations


--

**Discussion**: 

--

+ Summarize your work: imagine your reader skip directly to here after reading the title.
+ Summarize your contributions and what new insights you bring.
+ Discuss limitations.

--

<span style="color:royalblue">Practically: </span> I usually formally write the discussions last, but I keep track of the limitations that I would like to discuss here throughout the writing process. 


---
# The structure of the paper

A good analysis, theorem, or model $\neq$ a good paper.

--

A paper needs to have a story arc:  There should be a problem, reasons why some solutions are unsuccessful, and a solution that you can recommend (potentially with caveats).


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/arya.png")
```

--

<span style="color:royalblue">And the story needs to be told with the audience in mind!</span> 

---
# There should be stories within stories

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bran.webp")
```


---
# Take the abstract for example

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/nature.png")
```


---
# Statistics abstract example 1

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/abstract1.png")
```


---
# Statistics abstract example 2

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/abstract2.png")
```

---
# More generally in storytelling

It is impossible to define a specific formula for writing scientific papers. The meat of the paper can have many flavors. 


--
The general principle of storytelling holds in all sections

- Why you are writing the paper?
- What is the sequence of ideas you want to tell the reader? <span style="color:royalblue">This is usually different from how you arrive at the paper's current contents.</span>
- Will the reader be interested/curious when reading my paper?

--
- Use minimalism to achieve clarity: Can the points be conveyed just as well without X?
- Do not combine more than one major points in one paragraph.

---
# Stories within stories within stories

Which sentence do you prefer?

* The promise of our new approach is reduction of bias.
* Our new approach promises to reduce bias.

--

#### Principles of clarity
* Make main character subjects.
* Make important actions verbs.
* Go to your point quickly.


---
# Edit, edit, edit


### _Every single word that I publish, I write at least six times_
.right[Paul Halmos, Author, 'How to write mathematics']

#### Editing matters
--

+ If an explanation _sort-of_ works to you, your reader will be totally lost.

--

- If a word does not convey a precise meaning, it will be misinterpreted or your audience won't trust you. E.g., _worked quite well_ or _had X% better accuracy than_, _did not work_ or _failed to converge_.


--
+ Catching your own errors is hard. Reading sections aloud may help. 
+ Version control your writing
+ Get someone to read through your writing.
  
---
# Edit, edit, but do I still need to edit?

#### Editing takes time: 
The return of repeated editing diminish eventually, but you probably have a deadline before then.  Insufficient editing is obvious and unimpressive. But over-editing is common!


--
My strategy is to first write everything I have in mind down, before fine tuning each sentence in the introduction to make them perfectly fit in their boxes (unless I really feel the urge to do that). 

You should develop your own strategy that works for you. 



---
# Writing technical materials

In general, rules of formal writing apply.

--

Even in math-y materials, everything should be in complete sentences.
- Bad:    Consider $\hat\theta_n, n > p$.
- Good:   Consider $\hat\theta_n$, where $n > p$.
- Better: Consider the estimator $\hat\theta_n$, where $n > p$.

--

Be precise with words:
- principle components or principal components
- causal or casual
- the 'statistical' meaning vs the 'lay' meaning: confidence, consistent, robust, profile, ... 

--

Show the relevant information:
- graphics with clear annotations.
- explain what is in the table/figure in captions.

---
# Main takeaways
1. Do not be afraid of writing.
1. Know your audience.
1. Write to tell a story: within a sentence, paragraph, section, and paper.
1. Be formal, precise, and clear.
1. Edit your writing.

# LaTeX 

LaTeX is a software system for document preparation.
	
--

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a useful place to start.

--
- My setup: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) + [LaTeXTools](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

--
- Using a [Makefile](https://github.com/richardli/Writing-intro/blob/master/tex-examples/Makefile) from command line.

--
- There are many other editors.

--
- Use BibTex to manage your references.

---
# Reproducible research

The purpose of research is not just solving a problem, but to teach people how to solve similar problems. 

--

A good research paper should contain enough information to allow an informed reader to reproduce/verify the results.
--

- proofs
- implementable algorithms and parameter settings
- data or how to obtain the data (whenever possible)

--

Informal documents can usually also benefit greatly from reproducibility.

--

What's the benefit for _you_?
- You usually need to re-run your analysis or re-visit some parts of the project in the future. 
- You can more easily recycle re-useable parts for the future.
- Collaborators like you more!

---
# Develop a good writing / analysis workflow

--
Always make sure you can reproduce results, and that you can easily let others reproduce them.

--
Some specific recommendations:
+ Use relative paths. Check out R package [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).
+ Set seed.
+ Comment your codes in structured way. Check out syntax of [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/).
+ Follow a style guide in coding, tidy your codes manually or with `Tidy = TRUE`.
+ Use `session_info()` to document package versions.
+ Use README file to give instructions (package versions, directory structures, any additional dependencies).


--
Version control your code and documents with Git. You can use a local workflow for yourself. If you need to collaborate with others, Git becomes more essential. 

My past STAT 200 Git tutorial is [here](https://github.com/richardli/Git-Intro).

But there is also great benefit!]
